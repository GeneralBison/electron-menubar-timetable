# Electron Timetable [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/willyb321/electron-menubar-timetable.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/willyb321/electron-menubar-timetable)
TimeTable in the menubar using electron. I have a [website](http://bit.ly/1XXz4iH) for this project.

# How to use?  
Clone the repo, ~~and then replace images ./img/a.png and ./img/b.png with your own timetable.~~ I will eventually come up with a better way of doing this. I did. Now you just select your own images on opening the app.    
Run `npm install`.  
Package the files using your preferred method of packaging, and then run it. It'll appear in your menubar, and a dialog will come up - select your 2 timetable images, and press open, then boom, timetable!    
???  
Profit.  
You can click on the image to change from week a to week b. If you only have one week in your timetable, ~~just remove b.png from ./img folder~~  
At the moment, only OS X is supported, because Windows/Linux doesn't have a menubar.
