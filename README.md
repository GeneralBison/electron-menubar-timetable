# Electron Timetable [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/willyb321/electron-menubar-timetable.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/willyb321/electron-menubar-timetable)
TimeTable in the menubar using electron. I have a [website](http://bit.ly/1XXz4iH) for this project.
***
# How to use?  
Clone the repo, and then replace images a.png and b.png with your own timetable. Run NPM install for good measure.  
Package the files using your preferred method of packaging, and then run it. It'll appear in your menubar.  
???  
Profit.  
You can click on the image to change from week a to week b. If you only have one week in your timetable, just remove b.png from ./img folder  
At the moment, only OS X is supported, because Windows/Linux doesn't have a menubar.
