Run NPM install for good measure.  \r\nPackage the files using your preferred method of packaging, and then run it. It'll appear in your menubar.  \r\n???  \r\nProfit.  \r\nYou can click on the image to change from week a to week b. If you only have one week in your timetable, just remove b.png from ./img folder  \r\nAt the moment, only OS X is supported, because Windows/Linux doesn't have a menubar.\r\n***\r\n# Credits\r\n<https://github.com/maxogden/menubar> - used for menubar  \r\n<https://electron.atom.io> - for the main thing\r\n***\r\n# Example\r\n![Example](https://github.com/willyb321/electron-menubar-timetable/raw/master/example.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
